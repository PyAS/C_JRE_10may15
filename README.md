* With his initials, call him JRE.

* JRE has made a lot of tutorials on various topics uploaded on his youtube channel. His youtube link is in his name above. One of them is on C-programming. I thought I could try.

* Therefore, this folder consists of my exercises while watching his series of 9 videos on C.

### __Happy C-ing!__
